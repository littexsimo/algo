\section{Exercise 1}

Provide a linear time algorithm that takes in input a weighted directed graph $G = (V, E)$,
with costs on theedges $c(e)$ for $e∈E$ (cost may be negative), a node $t∈V$ and,
for each $v∈V$ a value $d(v)$,and decides whether for each $v ∈ V$ it is true that $d(v)$ is the
cost of the path of minimum cost among all the paths from from $v$ to $t$.

\subsection{First Observation}

We change the cost of each edge $e(v,w)$ according to the formula $$ c_{new}(e) = c(e)-d(v)+d(w)$$

\begin{itemize}

\item if $c_{new}(e)  < 0$ the minimum cost didn't take in account the edge because $d(w) - d(v)$ is greater
than the cost of the current edge so the cost are not correct;

\item if $c_{new}(e)  = 0$ the minimum path from $v$ to $t$ passes through this edge;

\item if $c_{new}(e)  > 0$ the edge is not part of the minimum path from $v$ to $t$;


\end{itemize}

\subsection{Second Observation}

If there exist a path from $v$ to $t$ of cost c and we reverse all the edges, there should be a path from $t$ to $v$ with cost $c$;

\subsection{Algorithm}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Suppose that if $t$ is not reachable from a vertex $v$, $ d(v) = + \infty$;
\item For each edge $e(v,w)$, change its cost to $ c_{new}(e) $;

\item Reverse the direction of all edges;

\item Starting from $t$, do a modified DFS in the following way:

\item For each edge $e(v,w)$ that is outgoing from the current vertex $v$:

\begin{itemize}


\item If $c_{new}(e) = 0$: visit the node $w$
\item If $c_{new}(e) < 0$: return false
\item If $c_{new}(e) > 0$: ignore the edge

\end{itemize}

\item If there exist a node $v$ not visited by the algorithm such that $d(v) < +\infty$: return false;
\item Return true;


\end{enumerate}


\section{Exercise 2}

You are given a weighted directed graph $G = (V, E)$, with costs on the edges $c(e)$ for $e ∈ E$ (cost may
be negative), a node $t ∈ V$ and, for each $v ∈ V$ a value $d(v)$ which is the cost of a path of minimum cost
from $v$ to $t$. Provide an $O(|E| log |V |)$ algorithm that given G, $d()$ and a node $t \neq t'$ computes, for each
$v ∈ V$ the minimum cost of a path from $v$ to $t'$.
\\\\
Here is the algorithm:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Reverse the direction of each edge $e(v, w)$
  \item For each edge, compute a new cost $\chi(e) = c(e)-d(v)+d(w)$
  \item Do a Dijkstra starting from the node $t$ and using the costs $\chi(e)$
  \item Let $\gamma(v)$ be the minimum path costs computed at the previous step
  \item The min cost of the path from a node $v$ to $t$ is then given by $$d_{t'}(v) = d(v) + \gamma(v) - d(t')$$
  \item Note that if $t'$ is not reachable from $v$ in the original graph, then $\gamma(v) = +\infty$ so $d_{t'}(v) = +\infty$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{}


\section{Exercise 3}

Show that if we apply the algorithm seen in class to find the min-cost circulation for the network shown
in the figure, there exist a sequence of choices of the cycle along which we improve that require $2*10^6$
iteration to solve the problem.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Algorithm}

The steps of the algorithm saw in the class are:
\begin{enumerate}

\item Find a Feasible circulation $Fc$ for N
\item While $R(Fc)$ has no negative cycle C, then $Fc = Sw(Fc,C)$

\end{enumerate}



The fist step of the algorithm saw in the class is to produce the residual graph

	\path[every node/.style={sloped,anchor=south,auto=false}] (a) edge [bend right] node {\tiny$1$    \euro{0}} (c);
	\path[every node/.style={sloped,anchor=south,auto=false}] (a) edge [bend left=60] node {\tiny$1$    \euro{0}} (d);

 \end{tikzpicture}

the graph above is the result of the first iteration of the worst choice that the algoithm can do.

\begin{tikzpicture}[
  ->,
  >=stealth',
  shorten >=1pt,
  auto,
  node distance=2.8cm,
  semithick,

        \tikzstyle{every state}=[
            draw = black,
            thick,
            fill = white,
            minimum size = 2mm
        ]

        \node[state] (a) {$A$};
        \node[state] (b) [right of=a]{$B$};
        \node[state] (c) [below right of=a]{$C$};
        \node[state] (d) [right of=b]{$D$};


        \path[every node/.style={sloped,anchor=south,auto=false}] (a) edge node {\tiny$[0,(10^6)-1]$    \euro{0}} (b);
        \path[every node/.style={sloped,anchor=south,auto=false}] (a) edge node {\tiny$[0,(10^6)-1]$    \euro{0}} (c);
        \path[every node/.style={sloped,anchor=south,auto=false}] (b) edge node {\tiny$[0,(10^6)-1]$    \euro{0}} (d);
        \path[every node/.style={sloped,anchor=south,auto=false}] (c) edge node {\tiny$[0,(10^6)-1] $    \euro{0}} (d);
        \path[every node/.style={sloped,anchor=south,auto=false}] (b) edge node {\tiny$[0,1]$    \euro{0}} (c);
        \path[every node/.style={sloped,anchor=south,auto=false}] (d) edge [bend right = 35] node {\tiny$[0,(2*10^6)-2]$    \euro{-1}} (a);

	\path[every node/.style={sloped,anchor=south,auto=false}] (b) edge [bend right] node {\tiny$1$    \euro{0}} (a);
	\path[every node/.style={sloped,anchor=south,auto=false}] (d) edge [bend left=25] node {\tiny$1 $    \euro{0}} (c);
	\path[every node/.style={sloped,anchor=south,auto=false}] (a) edge [bend right] node {\tiny$1$    \euro{0}} (c);
	\path[every node/.style={sloped,anchor=south,auto=false}] (a) edge [bend left=60] node {\tiny$2$    \euro{0}} (d);
	\path[every node/.style={sloped,anchor=south,auto=false}] (d) edge [bend right] node {\tiny$1$    \euro{0}} (b);



 \end{tikzpicture}

the second graph is the second iteration and if we continue to take the path from A to D passing each time from the edge between B and C
( the path ABCD and ACBD )
the result is a repeat of this two iterations above and using this choice we have that the algorithm takes $2*10^6$ iterations.


\section{Exercise 4}

Assume that the following matrix has to be tested for the C1P. Using the algorithm seen in class provide
\begin{enumerate}

\item[a] The overlap graph
\item[b] The containment graph

\end{enumerate}

If the matrix has the C1P, provide 3 distict permutations of the columns that leave the 1s consecutive
in each row (if there are fewer than 3 possible such permutations, provide them all). If the matrix does not have the C1P then apply the gap minimization algorithm considering only the last 5 columns.

\section{Exercise 5}

A lab is seriously facing shortage of primary storage space for its files/data. The lab has to buying/rent
secondary remote storage facilities. Preliminary analyses have indicated this as a better solution than
in-house expansion of the primary storage. The different available options have both limitations in the
maximum amount of space offered and costs related to the access of the information, once stored there.
We are interested in determining the optimal policy to choose how to distribute the files not anymore
fitting in-house on different secondary remote storage facilities in order to limit the cost incurred by taking
into account the different expected usage rate of the different type of information we are relocating.
Assume there are n remote facilities where to relocate the exceeding files. Let $\alpha_j$ be the maximum
amount of information on the remote facility j and $\chi_j$ be the cost to access one unit of information
from this facility. We assume that the information we need to store remotely is divided into m different
categories, each one of which is accessed with some rate. Let $\gamma_i$ be the amount of information units from
the category i, and let $\rho_i$ be the rate (how many times per unit time) a unit of information from category
i will need to be retrieved. We aim at storing/distributing the information in the different remote storage
places in order to minimize the overall expected cost of retrieval.
\\\\
a) Build a circulation network in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Add a node $C_i$ for each category $i$
  \item Add a node $S_j$ for each storage facility $j$
  \item Add an edge from each $C_i$ to each $S_j$ with cost $\rho_i * \chi_j$, capacity $+\infty$ and demand $0$
  \item Add two nodes $B$, $E$ that act as source and sink
  \item For each $C_i$ add an edge $e(B, C_i)$ with cost $0$, capacity and demand equal to $\gamma_i$.
  \item For each $S_j$ add an edge $e(C_i, E)$ with cost $0$, capacity $\alpha_j$ and demand $0$.
  \item add an edge $x(E, B)$ with capacity $+\infty$, demand and cost $0$.
\end{itemize}

b) If we assign the category with maximum rate to the minimum cost storage
\begin{itemize}
  \item Suppose that we take two categories $a, b$ and two facilities $x, y$ such
    that $\rho_a >= \rho_b$ and $\chi_x <= \chi_y$.
  \item Suppose also that $a$ and $x$ are the choices of the greedy algorithm at step $i$
    and that $b$ and $y$ are respectively another category and another facility that a different algorithm could take.
  \item If we prove that $$\rho_a * \chi_x + \rho_b * \chi_y <= \rho_a * \chi_y + \rho_b * \chi_x$$
    then $a$ and $x$ are the globally best choices to match at step $i$.
  \item Rearranging terms:
    $$\rho_a * \chi_x - \rho_a * \chi_y <= \rho_b * \chi_y - \rho_b * \chi_x$$
  \item Recollecting $\rho_a$ and $\rho_b$:
    $$\rho_a * (\chi_x - \chi_y) <= \rho_b * (\chi_x - \chi_y)$$
  \item If $\chi_x = \chi_y$ the expression is true
  \item We know that $z = (\chi_x - \chi_y) < 0$ by assumption
  \item If $\chi_x < \chi_y$ we have that $\rho_a * z <= \rho_b * z$
    so it's true only if $\rho_a >= \rho_b$ but this condition is also an initial assumption, so the expression is also true.
\end{itemize}
